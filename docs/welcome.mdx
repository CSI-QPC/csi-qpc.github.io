# Quantitative Proteomics Core

The Quantitative Proteomics Core (QPC) at CSI Singapore supports researchers across the full lifecycle of proteomics studies — from experimental design and sample preparation to state-of-the-art high-resolution mass spectrometry, data analysis, visualization, long-term data management and scientific discussions.

We work closely with research teams on a wide range of applications, including complex clinical and tissue samples, to ensure robust, interpretable, and publication-ready results.
