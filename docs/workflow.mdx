# How We Support Quantitative Proteomics Projects
<br />

Our collaborations typically progress through the stages below, and we encourage early discussion, even at the idea or pilot stage, to assess feasibility and study design. We typically work closely with PIs, postdocs, and students throughout the project.

## Workflow overview

Our workflows are designed to support proteomics studies from initial consultation through data interpretation.  
Each project is discussed and tailored to ensure technical feasibility, appropriate experimental design, and biologically meaningful outcomes.

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 1. Consultation and study planning

Each project begins with discussion to clarify the biological question, sample type, and experimental constraints. Study design considerations — including controls, replication, and quantitative strategy — are reviewed to ensure feasibility and robustness before experimental work begins.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 2. Sample preparation and experimental execution

Samples are processed using established and optimised workflows appropriate for the study design. Depending on the application, this may include enrichment strategies, fractionation, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 3. Data processing and quality control

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using validated analysis pipelines. Quality control is performed at multiple stages to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance prior to downstream interpretation.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 4. Data analysis and interpretation

Processed data are evaluated through statistical analysis and visualisation in the context of the original biological question. Interpretation of results are prepared internally before being shared with collaborators.
</div>

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 5. Data delivery and follow-up

Processed datasets, analysis outputs, and visualised results are shared with collaborators. Follow-up discussions may be arranged to clarify results, address questions, or plan subsequent experiments.
