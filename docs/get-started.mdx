# Start a collaboration
<br />

We encourage early discussion — even at the idea or pilot stage — to assess feasibility, align expectations, and design a robust quantitative proteomics study around real biological and practical constraints.

You do not need a fully defined workflow to start a conversation. This page outlines when to reach out, what information is helpful to share, and what to expect from an initial discussion.

## When to contact QPC

Early engagement is especially helpful if:

- You are planning a proteomics study and want to confirm feasibility or study design  
- Sample amount is limited, precious, or difficult to reproduce  
- You are unsure which proteomics approach is most appropriate  
- You would like input on controls, replication, or quantitative strategy  
- You have preliminary or pilot data and want to assess what conclusions are supported  

If you are uncertain whether your project is suitable, we encourage you to reach out and discuss.

<details>
<summary>What to share for a first discussion</summary>

A short message is usually sufficient. If some details are not yet available, share what you know.

**Scientific context**
- Biological question or hypothesis (1–2 sentences)
- System and sample type (e.g. cell line, tissue, clinical material)

**Study design (if available)**
- Conditions to compare
- Approximate number of conditions or samples

**Practical considerations**
- Expected sample amount and any material constraints
- Buffer, reagent, or processing constraints

<details>
<summary>What to expect after reaching out</summary>

Following an initial discussion, we typically:

- Clarify the biological objective and what the data should be able to support  
- Recommend a suitable quantitative strategy and key design considerations  
- Discuss sample preparation and handling requirements  
- Align on scope, timelines, and useful deliverables  

For ongoing projects, discussions may continue iteratively as data becomes available.

<summary>What collaborators typically receive</summary>

Depending on study design and scope, QPC support may include:

- Quality-controlled, analysed datasets aligned to the original biological question  
- Publication-ready figures and summary visualisations  
- Access to processed outputs alongside secure storage of raw mass spectrometry data  
- Follow-up discussions to interpret results and assess robustness and limitations  
- Iterative support for downstream questions or follow-up experiments  
- Input on proteomics-related aspects of manuscripts where appropriate  

The exact form and depth of support are discussed upfront and may evolve as the project progresses.
