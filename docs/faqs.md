# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting started & collaboration

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you offer trial or pilot experiments?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Sometimes.
    
    Pilot or trial experiments may be considered when they are scientifically justified and add value to study design or feasibility assessment.

    These are typically scoped more narrowly and may be higher in cost per sample compared to full quantitative workflows, as they involve bespoke setup and optimization rather than standardized processing.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do I need to discuss my project before submitting samples?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Yes. Prior discussion is required before sample submission.

    Quantitative proteomics experiments are highly sensitive to study design, controls, and sample handling. Early discussion allows us to assess feasibility, advise on experimental design, and ensure that the resulting data will be robust and interpretable.

    In some cases, we may decline samples if we are not confident that meaningful data can be generated.

<details>
  <summary><strong>What does “collaborative support” mean?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Collaborative support means that we work closely with research teams as scientific partners throughout the proteomics workflow, rather than operating as a sample-in, data-out service.

    We contribute expertise in experimental design, workflow selection, data quality assessment, and interpretation, while operating on a cost-recovery basis to sustain shared research infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is authorship expected for collaborative projects?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Authorship is not automatically expected.

    Authorship considerations depend on the nature and extent of scientific contributions by the QPC team, beyond routine sample processing. This may include involvement in experimental design, method development, data interpretation, or intellectual input that materially shapes the study.

    We encourage open discussion around expectations early in the collaboration to ensure alignment.

## Samples & experimental workflow

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do I submit samples to the QPC?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Sample submission is coordinated following prior discussion.

    Please label tube lids clearly with your initials and a running number, along with the date of submission (e.g. Control: WKY1–WKY4; Condition 1: WKY5–WKY8). Experimental details, sample metadata, and study information should be provided using the softcopy sample submission form supplied by QPC.

    We ask that you inform us in advance before bringing samples, so we can ensure appropriate handling and receipt.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What sample types and formats do you accept?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Accepted sample types and formats depend on the experimental design and intended proteomics workflow.

    Certain reagents, buffers, or additives may interfere with downstream mass spectrometry analysis. We therefore recommend discussing sample composition with us in advance to ensure compatibility and avoid unnecessary sample loss.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I submit samples without prior consultation?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Submitting samples without prior consultation is strongly discouraged.

    Without sufficient understanding of the experimental context, study design, and objectives, we may be unable to process samples appropriately or generate interpretable data.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Who prepares the samples — my lab or QPC?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> The QPC team handles all steps related to mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including sample preparation, instrument measurement, data processing, and initial data interpretation.

    Upstream biological sample preparation (e.g. cell culture, tissue collection, treatment conditions) remains the responsibility of the collaborating laboratory.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you work with limited or precious samples?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <!-- Answer here --> Yes, in many cases we can work with limited or precious samples.

    Such projects require careful planning and discussion to assess feasibility, optimize workflows, and minimize sample loss. We encourage early consultation to explore suitable strategies.
