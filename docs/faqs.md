# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting started & collaboration

<details>
  <summary><strong>I’m new to proteomics — can QPC help me get started?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Many collaborators approach us at an early stage, even before a clear proteomics strategy has been defined.
    
    We can help translate biological questions into appropriate proteomics approaches, advise on study design, controls, and sample requirements, and discuss what is technically feasible. Early discussions are encouraged, especially for first-time or exploratory projects.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you offer trial or pilot experiments?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Pilot or trial experiments may be considered when they are scientifically justified and add value to study design or feasibility assessment.
    
    These are typically more narrowly scoped and may be higher in cost per sample compared to full quantitative workflows, as they often involve bespoke setup or optimization rather than standardized processing.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do I need to discuss my project before submitting samples?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Prior discussion is required before sample submission.
    
    Quantitative proteomics experiments are highly sensitive to study design, controls, and sample handling. Early discussion allows us to assess feasibility, advise on experimental design, and ensure that the resulting data will be robust and interpretable.
    
    In some cases, we may decline samples if we are not confident that meaningful data can be generated.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What does “collaborative support” mean?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Collaborative support means that we work closely with research teams as scientific partners throughout the proteomics workflow, rather than operating as a sample-in, data-out service.
    
    We contribute expertise in experimental design, workflow selection, data quality assessment, and data interpretation, while operating on a cost-recovery basis to sustain shared research infrastructure.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is authorship expected for collaborative projects?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Authorship is not automatically expected.
    
    Authorship considerations depend on the nature and extent of scientific contributions by the QPC team beyond routine sample processing. This may include involvement in experimental design, method development, data interpretation, or intellectual input that materially shapes the study.
    
    We encourage open discussion around expectations early in the collaboration to ensure alignment.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Who can collaborate with the QPC?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    We are open to collaborations with researchers both within and outside academia, including collaborators beyond Singapore.
    
    We welcome discussions with external academic groups and partners who are seeking quantitative proteomics support under a collaborative, research-oriented model.
  </p>

## Samples & experimental workflow

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do I submit samples to the QPC?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Sample submission is coordinated following prior discussion.
    
    Please label tube lids clearly with your initials and a running number, along with the date of submission (for example: Control: WKY1–WKY4; Condition 1: WKY5–WKY8). Experimental details, sample metadata, and study information should be provided using the softcopy sample submission form supplied by QPC.
    
    We ask that you inform us in advance before bringing samples so that we can ensure appropriate handling and receipt.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What sample types and formats do you accept?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Accepted sample types and formats depend on the experimental design and intended proteomics workflow.
    
    Certain reagents, buffers, or additives may interfere with downstream mass spectrometry analysis. We therefore recommend discussing sample composition with us in advance to ensure compatibility and avoid unnecessary sample loss.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I submit samples without prior consultation?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Submitting samples without prior consultation is strongly discouraged.
    
    Without sufficient understanding of the experimental context, study design, and objectives, we may be unable to process samples appropriately or generate interpretable data.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Who prepares the samples — my lab or QPC?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    The QPC team handles all steps related to mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including sample preparation, instrument measurement, data processing, and initial data interpretation.
    
    Upstream biological sample preparation, such as cell culture, tissue collection, and treatment conditions, remains the responsibility of the collaborating laboratory.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you work with limited or precious samples?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes, in many cases we can work with limited or precious samples.
    
    Such projects require careful planning and discussion to assess feasibility, optimize workflows, and minimize sample loss. Early consultation is strongly encouraged.
  </p>
</details>

## Data, analysis & deliverables

<details>
  <summary><strong>What data and results will I receive?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Collaborators typically receive both raw outputs from analysis software (for example, MaxQuant) and processed, quality-controlled datasets.
    
    Data processing steps are documented, including handling of missing or zero values in LFQ analyses. For most proteome and interactome studies, pairwise volcano plots are provided as publication-ready figures. Processed tables are also formatted to serve directly as supplementary material for manuscripts.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you provide downstream data analysis and interpretation?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Initial data delivery typically includes processed datasets and pairwise comparisons with standard visualizations such as volcano plots.
    
    Additional downstream analyses, including heatmaps, functional enrichment, or other exploratory analyses, may be supported depending on the project and should be discussed in advance.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Will I receive publication-ready figures?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Where applicable, figures generated during analysis are prepared to a standard suitable for inclusion in manuscripts.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you re-analyse existing proteomics datasets?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes, we can support re-analysis of datasets generated within the QPC, subject to data availability and scope of work.
  </p>

## Charges, timelines & administration

<details>
  <summary><strong>How are charges determined?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    For academic users, charges are set on a cost-recovery basis covering consumables.
    
    To encourage appropriate replication for LFQ studies, pricing is typically bundled in packages of four replicates for proteome and interactome analyses. Clinical samples and imaging mass spectrometry studies are charged on a per-sample basis.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How long does a typical project take?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Our typical turnaround time is approximately four to six weeks, depending on project complexity, sample type, and instrument availability.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How does billing and invoicing work?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Invoicing is initiated after analysed data have been returned to collaborators.
    
    For NUS departments, including Duke-NUS, billing is handled via internal journal transfers. For collaborators outside NUS, invoices are issued to the provided billing address, and payments are accepted via bank transfer.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you support externally funded or grant-based projects?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. We support both grant-funded and externally funded projects, subject to alignment with our expertise and capacity.
