# Our Platforms and Instruments

Our instrumentation supports quantitative proteomics workflows across discovery, interaction, and spatial analyses. Platforms are selected based on study design, sample type, and analytical requirements.

**Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)**

We operate high-resolution LC–MS systems for quantitative proteomics and interactome studies, supporting both discovery and targeted applications.

LC–MS platforms include:
- Bruker timsTOF fleX mass spectrometer
- Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer
- Evosep One liquid chromatography system

**Imaging mass spectrometry**

We support imaging mass spectrometry for spatially resolved proteomics and tissue-based studies.

Imaging platforms include:
- Bruker timsTOF fleX MALDI imaging mass spectrometry capabilities

**Sample processing**

Sample preparation workflows are supported by dedicated front-end instrumentation for reproducible and robust tissue processing.

Sample preparation platforms include:
- Bruker BeatBox tissue homogenizer
