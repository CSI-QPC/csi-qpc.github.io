# Facility Head
<br />

**Dr Dennis KAPPEI**

Dennis’ research group uses their expertise in quantitative proteomics to study chromatin changes in the context of telomere-driven genome instability. Through the Quantitative Proteomics Core, this know-how in mass spectrometry applications is shared with CSI and the wider Singapore research community.

# Team
<br />

**Dr Wai Khang YONG**<br />
Core Facility Manager

Wai Khang earned a PhD from NUS Graduate School's Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP). His research centers on investigating chromatin protein-DNA interactions through ChIP-MS. With meticulous attention to technical nuances, he has implemented in-house experimental pipelines for ChIP-MS, surface membrane proteomics, and PTM enrichment.<br /><br />

**Dr Sakshi RAJORIA**<br />
Research Fellow

After graduate training at the Defence Research and Development Establishment in Madhya Pradesh, Sakshi spent initial postdoctoral stints at IIT Bombay and the University of Massachusetts. In our team she is developing spatial proteomics workflows to analyse tissue samples by imaging mass spectrometry.<br /><br />

**Vartika KHANCHANDANI**<br />
Research Assistant

Vartika earned a Bachelor of Engineering from the R.V. College of Engineering in Bangalore. In our group, she is applying her bioinformatics skills to the development of streamlined analysis pipelines.<br /><br />

**Jie Min LEE**<br />
Research Assistant

Jie Min earned her Bachelor of Science in Microbiology from the University of Malaya. As part of the QPC, she studies protein expression and interactions in various biological contexts. Her role encompasses different aspects of mass spectrometry, including sample preparation, instrument operation, maintenance and data analysis.<br /><br />

**Sumedha PUNDRIK**<br />
Research Assistant

Sumedha obtained her MSc in Precision Medicine from the University of Manchester. Within the team, she manages tasks related to sample preparation and data analysis, focusing on investigating protein expression and interactions across diverse biological contexts.<br /><br />
