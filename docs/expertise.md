# Expertise

Our expertise spans quantitative proteomics approaches for studying protein abundance, interactions, and spatial organization. We support a broad range of biological questions across discovery, hypothesis-driven, and translational studies.

**Proteome analysis**

We support global and targeted proteome analyses to quantify protein expression across biological conditions. This includes comparative studies, perturbation experiments, and analysis of complex samples such as tissues and clinical materials.

**Interactome analysis**

We provide expertise in studying protein–protein interactions to elucidate molecular complexes and interaction networks. Interactome workflows are tailored to the biological context and experimental system, with attention to appropriate controls and quantitative interpretation.

**Imaging mass spectrometry**

We support imaging mass spectrometry approaches for spatially resolved proteomics. These workflows enable the investigation of protein distribution and localization within tissues, complementing bulk proteomics measurements with spatial context.

**Study types and applications**

Our expertise supports a range of study types, including:
- Discovery and comparative proteomics
- Mechanistic studies and pathway analysis
- Clinical and translational research
- Tissue-based and spatial proteomics applications
