# What We Offer
<br />

**How we work with collaborators**

We work closely with research teams to support proteomics studies from planning to interpretation. Our approach emphasizes early alignment on scientific questions, experimental design, and technical feasibility to ensure robust and reproducible outcomes.

**From question to experiment**

We help translate biological questions into appropriate proteomics strategies, advising on study design, controls, sample types, and workflow selection. Where needed, pilot studies and optimization are discussed before large-scale experiments.

**From data to insight**

Beyond data acquisition, we support data processing, quality assessment, and interpretation, working with collaborators to ensure results are biologically meaningful and analytically sound.

**What collaborators receive**

- Experimental design and workflow guidance
- Access to quantitative proteomics and mass spectrometry platforms and workflows
- Processed, quality-controlled datasets
- Documentation of methods and analysis parameters
- Support with data interpretation and discussion
- Manuscript support regarding quantitative proteomics
