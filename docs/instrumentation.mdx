# Our Platforms and Instruments
<br />

Our instrumentation supports quantitative proteomics workflows across discovery, interaction, and spatial analyses.  
Platforms are selected based on study design, sample type, and analytical requirements, rather than a fixed menu.

## Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)

High-resolution LC–MS systems are operated for quantitative proteomics and interaction studies, supporting discovery-oriented and targeted applications.

## Imaging mass spectrometry

Imaging mass spectrometry supports spatially resolved analyses and tissue-based studies where localisation is part of the biological question.

<div className="qpc-approach-grid">

  <div className="qpc-approach-card">
    <div className="qpc-stepTitle">
      <span>Bruker timsTOF fleX (MALDI imaging)</span>
    </div>
    <div className="qpc-stepBody">
      MALDI imaging capabilities enable spatial profiling workflows, planned in conjunction with tissue context and experimental constraints.
    </div>
  </div>

## Sample processing

Front-end processing instrumentation supports reproducible preparation of biological samples prior to mass spectrometry analysis.

<div className="qpc-approach-grid">

  <div className="qpc-approach-card">
    <div className="qpc-stepTitle">
      <span>Bruker BeatBox tissue homogenizer</span>
    </div>
    <div className="qpc-stepBody">
      Supports consistent tissue disruption and sample preparation, especially for workflows where uniformity and reproducibility are important.
